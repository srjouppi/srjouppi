# I'm Shelby ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm a freelance data reporter helping local newsrooms find creative ways to bolster their work with data collection, analysis, visualization and public service tools.
Before going back to get my master's in data journalism from Columbia University in 2021, I was a reporter at Detroit's NPR station, a
digital news + graphic designer, and a podcast producer.

ðŸª´ **Beats:**
Health care, public health and child + family issues

âœ¨ **Things I Love:**
* **Enterprise data collection.** I write web scrapers, find APIs, parse PDFs, analyze text in order to find creative ways to quantify things.
* **Super speedy data wrangling.** I clean and merge large datasets mostly using python, and it's a blast.
* **Audience-first reporting.** I look for ways to turn my or a colleague's reporting into an accessible tool for the audience. I also think newsrooms are more effective when they make journalism _for_ and not just _about_ a community, and I love working on audience-driven projects.
  
* **Stories that contextualize problems we feel.**
