# I'm Shelby ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm a freelance data journalist helping local newsrooms find creative ways to bolster their reporting with data collection, analysis, and visualization.
Before going back to get my master's in data journalism from Columbia University, I was a reporter at Detroit's NPR station, a
digital news designer, and a podcast producer.

ðŸª´ **Beats:**
Health care, public health and child + family issues

âœ¨ **Things I Love:**
* **Capturing unstructured data.** I write web scrapers, find APIs, parse PDFs, analyze text, or even make my own datasets in order to find creative ways to quantify things.
* **Super speedy data wrangling.** I clean and merge large datasets mostly using python, and it's a blast.
* **Audience-first reporting.** I look for ways to turn my or a colleague's reporting into an accessible tool for the audience. I also think journalists are more effective when they make journalism _for_ and not just _about_ a community, and I love working on those kinds of projects.
* **Stories that contextualize problems we feel.**
