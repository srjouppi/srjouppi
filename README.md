# I'm Shelby ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm a data journalist currently finishing up my master's at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism in NYC.
I am job hunting and interested in freelancing, so please reach out if you would like to collaborate!

ðŸª´ **Beats:**
Health care, public health and child + family issues

âœ¨ **Things I Love:**
* **Scraping!** If I can contextualize a story with data that can only be scraped, I will happily write a script to do so. This is by far the skill I am most excited about.
* **Super speedy data wrangling.** I can read, clean and merge large datasets using python, and it's a blast. Have 2+ datasets you want to combine? no problem! I can do it in a few minutes.
* **Stories that contextualize problems we feel.**
