# I'm Shelby ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm an environmental data reporter covering pollution and enforcement for Public Health Watch. Before this, I worked as a freelancer helping local newsrooms find creative ways to bolster their work with data collection, analysis, visualization and public service tools. Prior to completing a master's in data journalism from Columbia University in 2021, I was a reporter at Detroit's NPR station, a digital news + graphic designer, and a podcast producer.

ðŸª´ **Beats:**
Public health and child + family issues

âœ¨ **Things I Love:**
* **Enterprise data collection.** I write web scrapers, find APIs, parse PDFs, analyze text and more in order to find creative ways to quantify things.
* **Speedy data wrangling.** I clean and merge large datasets mostly using python.
* **Audience-first reporting.** I look for ways to turn my or a colleague's reporting into an accessible tool for the audience. I think newsrooms are most effective when they make journalism _for_ and not just _about_ a community, and I love working on audience-driven projects.
